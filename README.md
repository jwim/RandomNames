I used python3, flask and sqlite3 for my task because they were mostly related to the job description. During this time I was able to finish task 1 and 2.
But I am not sure if I had set up the database correctly for sqlite3 to run in the background because the database creation is called everytime the application
is started.

3. Render a html file to display 100 names by using a python for loop ({%for name in names%}) within the html file
4. Modify the html code to include input box within the forloop. I can do a validation check but would have to look
at documentation on how I can link the logic. 
5-7. I am able to create the frontend but I am in the process of learning backend and creating functions within
web application. The task is not difficult but I would need time to go through documentation. 

I appreciate the time and opportunity from farapp! The coding assessment has given me a better idea of where I stand and
I should prepare myself for furutre opportunities.
